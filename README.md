we have added 6 sorting techniques to the colleges 

Sort Colleges Based on Options:
===============================

 1. Top 20 colleges 
 2. Colleges in Alphabetical order 
 3. Colleges Based on Student to Faculity Ratio 
 4. Colleges Based on Avg Retention Ration 
 5. Colleges Based on Tution Cost Range ("$"(Low)-"$$$$"(High) 
 6. Colleges Based on Placement Services
 7. Exit
 
 =>  7th option is to directly exit and also we add exit functionality after every option based on requirement we choose respective option.
